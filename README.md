# Love Labs Technology

## New Members Welcome

Welcome to Love Labs!

Whether you're single and looking for your soul mate, looking for friends, trying to help your single friends find love, or just curious/skeptical about how technology can find people love and best friendships, we're glad to have you in the group.

We believe that soul mates are just a subset of best friends, and that finding best friends is a search problem, and that the search speed and ease can be solved with engineering features over human personality, and also looking at where people can find parters with the same life goals as theirs.

A lot has changed in the world of relationships over the last century. A book I read called "Marriage, A History" had a lot of thoughts on how economic changes brought on by the industrial revolution kicked off romanticism as well as disconnection from our families to provide us community and work, and somehow this has led to where we are now, the fewest marriages, fewest births, latest aged partnerships in history.

We hope to find those still looking for the best friends and partners they seek. 

If you're curious, please come attend our sessions, or sign up for an awesome conference experience with us today!

Love,
Matt & Ngan
