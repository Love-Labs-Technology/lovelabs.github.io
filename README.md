# Love Labs Technology

## New Members Welcome

Welcome to Love Labs!

Whether you're single and looking for your soul mate, looking for friends, trying to help your single friends find love, or just curious/skeptical about how technology can find people love and best friendships, we're glad to have you in the group.

We believe that soul mates are just a subset of best friends, and that finding best friends is a search problem, and that the search speed and ease can be solved with engineering features over human personality, and also looking at where people can find parters with the same life goals as thiers.

A lot has changed in the world of relationships over the last century. A book I read called "Marriage, A History" had a lot of thoughts on how economic changes brought on by the industrial revolution kicked off romanticism as well as disconnection from our families to provide us community and work, and somehow this has led to where we are now, the fewest marriages, fewest births, latest aged partnerships in history.

We hope to find those still looking the partners they seek, so they can get married and have families. 

We think men in the Bay Area are a perfect example of men with all the qualities that would have gained them status as husbands and dads in the past, they are smart, conscientious, and successful. We feel a major component of their singleness is just a geographic misfortune brought on by many factors we could discuss in depth at any meetup. But through the travels of the founders of Love Labs, we realized that there are still many women in the world looking to marry these men, and would love to have a husband as smart, curious, educated, and loyal as the men here.

A certain hopelessness afflicted me before I left the bay to find a partner, and I see it in many of my single friends too. We hope to cure the bay of this hopelessness, and find many of them love.

If you're curious, please come attend our sessions, or sign up for an awesome vacation with us today!

Love,
Matt, Jackson, & Ngan
